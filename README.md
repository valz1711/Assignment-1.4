1)Sources of Data Flood:
  ·This flood of data is coming from many sources.
  ·The New York stock exchange generates about 4-5 terabytes of data every day.
  ·Facebook hosts more than 240 billion photos, growing at a 7 petabytes of data every day.
  ·Ancestory.com, the genealogy site stores around 10 petabytes of the data.
  ·The internet archive stores around 18.5 petabytes of data.
  ·The large Hadron Collider near Geneva produces about 30 petabytes of data every year.

2)Big data:
                    Big Data is a concept in Software Engineering which we use when we have a large sets of machine generated data, which in most of the cases is unstructured and not easy to use with traditional RDBMS concepts. 
  Data:
                    Data Analytics on the other hand is more of analyzing data which could be structured or unstructured. Even though they both sound similar, there have different objectives. Out of huge data sets, when you want to narrow down a piece of customized data, we do number of steps in analyzing like investigating data, cleaning, transforming and getting the result.
 
3 )Main reason behind the Hadoop become the solution for Data explosion:           
  ·Hadoop is an open source ,java-based programming framework that supports the processing of large data sets in a distributed computing environment.
  ·Hadoop provides: A reliable,Scalable platform for storage and analysis.
  ·It is based on Google File Syatem or GFS.
  ·Hadoop runs a number of applications on distributed systems with thousands of nodes involving petabytes of data.
  ·It has a distributed file system,called the Hadoop Distributed File System or HDFS,which enable fast data transfer among the nodes.
